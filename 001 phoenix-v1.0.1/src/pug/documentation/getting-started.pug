    p.mb-0 Looking to start your project quickly? Just unzip the 
        code #{theme}.zip
        | . We have precompiled and packaged everything in the 
        code public
        |  directory for you. Start editing the 
        code public/pages/starter.html
        |  with a text or code editor, save it, and open the file in your favourite browser to see the changes.

  +ComponentCard({title: 'Setting up Build system', hideNavTab: true}).my-4
    p Unzip the 
      code #{theme}.zip
      |  to any folder and open a command line or terminal at that location.
      | theme's dev tools require 
      a(href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank') Node
      |  and 
      a(href='https://git-scm.com/' target='_blank') Git
      |  . If you do not have them in your machine, please install their latest stable version from their corresponding website. As you have 
      span.fw-black.text-black Node and Git installed and accessible from your terminal or command line
      | , install the rest of the themeâ€™s dependencies with: 
    pre
      code.lang-html.
        npm i

    p.mt-4 Now to start webpack development server run:
    pre
      code.lang-html.
        npm start

    p.mt-4 Webpack will compile the SCSS, transpile the typescript/javascript and will open a browser window to 
      code public/index.html
    p All of the files from 
      code src 
      | folder are monitored for changes, which will tell the browser to reload automatically after any changes are made:

    p.mt-4 Now you can edit any 
      code pug
      |  file from 
      code src/pug
      | , change SCSS variable with 
      code scss/_user-variables.scss
      | , or write your own SCSS code in 
      code scss/_user.scss
      |  and add or update 
      code javaScript
      |  from 
      code src/js
      |  directory. All files will be compiled and will be served from public folder.


    .alert.alert-soft-warning In development mode webpack will not write the compiled file to disk. It will be served from browser memory. 

    
    p.mt-4 By default dev server will compile pug files from 
      code ./src/pug 
      | folder. If you don't use pug, in 
      code ./webpack/webpack-utils.js 
      | file change  
      code pugBased 
      | variable to 
      code false 
    pre
      code.lang-html.
        const pugBased = false; //change this variable to false
        //...

    p.mt-4 Hit 
      code Ctrl+C
      |  or just close the command line window to stop the server.

    p Happy editing!
