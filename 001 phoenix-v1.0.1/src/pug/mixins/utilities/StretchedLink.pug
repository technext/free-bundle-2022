mixin StretchedLinkExampleDescription
  p&attributes(attributes) Add 
    code .stretched-link 
    |  to a link to make its containing block clickable via a 
    code ::after
    |  pseudo element. In most cases, this means that an element with 
    code position: relative; 
    |  that contains a link with the 
    code .stretched-link 
    |  class is clickable. 
  p Cards have 
    code position: relative 
    | by default in Bootstrap, so in this case you can safely add the 
    code .stretched-link 
    | class to a link in the card without any other HTML changes.
  p.mb-0 Multiple links and tap targets are not recommended with stretched links. However, some 
    code position 
    | and 
    code z-index 
    |  styles can help should this be required.

    | If the stretched link doesnâ€™t seem to work, the 
    a(href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#Identifying_the_containing_block') containing block
    |  will probably be the cause. The following CSS properties will make an element the containing block:
  ul.mb-0
    li
      | A 
      code position
      |  value other than 
      code static
    li
      | A 
      code transform
      |  or 
      code perspective
      |  value other than 
      code none
    li
      | A 
      code will-change
      |  value of 
      code transform
      |  or 
      code perspective
    li
      | A 
      code filter
      |  value other than 
      code none
      |  or a 
      code will-change
      |  value of 
      code filter
      |  (only works on Firefox)
